K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.It stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K-NN algorithm. It can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
